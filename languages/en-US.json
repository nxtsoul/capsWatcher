    "ABOUT_TEXT":"The capsWatcher was created with the idea of allowing the community's free customization, given that the on-screen overlay is based on images. It was also designed to assist people using 60% or TKL keyboards who lack or do not have good indications of the state of toggle keys. The capsWatcher was developed using Python as its main language and the PyQt framework for displaying the interface and overlay. Thank you and enjoy using it."
